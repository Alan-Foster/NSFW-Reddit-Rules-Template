# NSFW-Reddit-Rules-Template
A template that NSFW subreddits can use to establish high quality, comprehensive rules for their community. Updated and maintained to cover as many edge-cases as possible. To view the rules list, click here: https://github.com/Alan-Foster/NSFW-Reddit-Rules-Template/blob/main/Rules-List

## Why was this created?
Many NSFW communities have rules that fail to encompass all rule violations, or are inconsistent across communities. This rule list is designed to be a master template by which the NSFW subreddits can standardize how violations are enforced.
