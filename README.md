## Why was this created?
Many NSFW communities have rules that are incomplete or inconsistent. This rule list is designed to be a master template to standardize how violations are enforced.

## How do I use this template?
Click the link above to view all of the template rules available. Copy and Paste the rules on your subreddit rule page found at https://www.reddit.com/r/SUBREDDIT/about/rules under the Moderation section of the Mod Tools page. Some rules require you to make a choice based on the way you manage your community, which are marked inside ///// sectionals \\\\\\\ to make it easy to see.

Then, navigate to https://www.reddit.com/r/SUBREDDIT/about/removal to create Removal Reasons used internally by the mod team.

Rule violation responses are listed and can be customized. Most rules have 2 warnings before a perm ban. 
Some rules, such as Rule 1 - 18+ Age of Consent, have an immediate Ban for breaking the rule.
